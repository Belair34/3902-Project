Command Pattern Design Decisions:
	Two use cases for commands in this project.
	1, input commands that can be mapped to the button of a controller.

	***Not using this for now***
	2, item use commands, instances of which can be stored in the B slot field of the inventory class.
		These commands correspond to a effects of a single use of the B Slot by the player.
